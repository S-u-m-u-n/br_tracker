# br_tracker
Book &amp; Reading tracker for Linux Command Line
# Why?
Usually I read the same book on multiple devices, without having a way to synchronize the progress and often forgetting about the last page I read
# Usage:
- --add [book_name] [pages]
Add a book to the collection.
- --dele [book_name]
Delete a book from the collection.
- --upd [book_name] [current_page]
Update the reading progress of a book.
- --show
Show the progress of reading for all books.
